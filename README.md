## **myFUS: Custom software application for Ultrasound Breast Patch longitudinal study**

myFUS (mirror-my-First-UltraSound) is a custom software application created to help patients repeatedly position the ultrasound probe at the correct location on their breast. This computer vision application assists the user in placing the probe at the same location during the course of the longitudinal clinical study in order to generate high-quality ultrasound images of the tumour through the same ‘imaging window’ on their body - removing the inevitable variability and subjectivity in image datasets generated by human operators or medical personnel.
